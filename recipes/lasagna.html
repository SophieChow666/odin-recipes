        <h4>Direction</h4>
        <p>We love traditional pulled pork sandwiches, of course. Topped with a little coleslaw and some BBQ sauce, they can't be beat! But every once in a while, we want to pull our pork in a slightly different direction. These pulled pork recipes prove there's so much more to it than amazing sandwiches. We're talking about pulled pork pizza, nachos, pulled pork lasagna, soup, stew, and much more. So make a ton, you'll want plenty leftovers to make all of these top-rated recipes!

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Extra Crispy Tater TotsÂ®)</li>
          <li>2 cups shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
          <li>2 cups cooked pulled pork</li>
          <li>1 cup prepared coleslaw</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange potato nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Shake baking sheet and continue baking until potato nuggets are extra crispy, 20 to 24 minutes longer. Remove baking sheet from oven and turn on oven's broiler.</li>
        </ol>
