        <h4>Direction</h4>
        <p>Radishes are crisp and peppery, and when combined with a sweet, citrus-flavored dressing, everybody will be coming back for more of this refreshing salad. We enjoy it as a luncheon salad with crackers and garnished with hard-boiled egg wedges, but it's also the perfect sidekick for a spring/summer cookout or picnic.
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine radishes, peas, and red onion in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over the salad and give it a quick stir until well combined. If time permits, move the bowl to the refrigerator for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Serve garnished with hard-cooked egg wedges.</li>
        </ol>
